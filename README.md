# Food-Panda-Data-Analysis
Analysis of Food Panda Dataset using Python

📊 **FoodPanda Data Analysis**
This project analyzes FoodPanda delivery and order data to uncover trends, customer behavior insights, delivery performance, and operational patterns. Using Python-based data analysis techniques, the project provides actionable insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and reporting.

🚀 **Project Overview**
The goal of this analysis is to understand how FoodPanda operations behave over time and identify factors impacting order volume, customer retention, restaurant performance, and delivery efficiency.
This project includes:
Cleaning and preprocessing FoodPanda order data
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations of key trends
Insights on customer behavior and ordering patterns
Delivery partner performance analysis
Restaurant performance analytics
Data-driven recommendations

📂 **Dataset Description**

The dataset contains FoodPanda order logs with the following common fields:
Order ID – Unique order identifier
Customer ID – Unique customer reference
Restaurant Name
Cuisine Type
Order Date & Time
Delivery Time (in minutes)
Order Value (Price)
Order Status (Delivered / Cancelled / Incomplete)
Payment Type
Location / Zone

🧰 **Tech Stack**
This project uses:
Python 3.x
Pandas – Data cleaning and manipulation
NumPy – Numerical analysis
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualizations
Plotly (optional) – Interactive graphs
Jupyter Notebook – Analysis environment
